# diZcord
Project Zomboid / Discord integreation

This is based on the git [PZ-Disco](https://github.com/Blyzz616/PZ-Disco) but much more advanced.



Notes:
If you get double quit notifications on player disconnect, it may be an anti-cheat problem.
Try disableing anti-cheat 22 in Zomboid Server configuration.
